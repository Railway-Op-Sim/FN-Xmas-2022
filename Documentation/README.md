# Xmas 2022

This map is a bit of fun to celebrate Christmas 2022, the signals are used to simulate Christmas lights for a festive feel.

## Simulation

The purpose of this map is not to score highly, but rather just enjoy the lights flashing on and off. The only operation required is to loop the services
back around the map again. Note, you cannot form a loop route in RailOS, you must route the trains across the gap in two steps.
